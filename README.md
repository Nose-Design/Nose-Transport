# Nose Transport

Thanks to its expertise in the field of public transport and inspired by the dot matrix displays in Swiss trains, trams and buses, [Nose](https://nose.ch) has developed a family of fonts that makes it easier to work with text in visualisations for matrix displays.

The Nose Transport typeface family consists of three font sizes with four weight classes and two different pixel shapes each.
